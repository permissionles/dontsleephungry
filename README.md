# No one should go to sleep hungry

Humans have pulled a lot of shit together for a very long time.
It is stupid that we are letting people die of hunger when food is suprlus.
Either the ideas of people in-charge are bad or they are just inefficient.

But I think Opensource should take over.

We will build an inteface where anyone, anywhere in the world can request for food and someone can fulfill it.

More ideas are welcome :)
